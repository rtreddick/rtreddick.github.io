Welcome to the repo for my personal website! Visit the published site at https://www.timreddick.me.

## Creating this Site

I created this site using Jekyll and the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) template. It uses GitHub Actions to build and deploy to GitHub Pages. The first site I built with this template can be found here: https://www.timreddick.me/fcc-fastapi. I learned a lot about how to build Jekyll sites and how this particular template deploys during that process, so I decided to also use it for my personal website. Even though it's a documentation theme, I think it works pretty well here. I added a big, bold logo to the home page, which I think makes it feel a little less like technical documention when you land.

## Blog Post

I plan to write a blog post about my experience creating my first Jekyll sites, and in particular, I want to explain some of the customizations I made to the deploy process and some of the configurations I made to the theme. I also want to explore some alternative deployment patterns. I'll make this post to my personal website, and I'll add the link here when I do!
