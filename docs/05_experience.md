> I envision this as a place where I can expand on a few of things that are on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/) or on my resume. I will use Jekyll document collections and Liquid templating to fill this with content. I can use the patterns I learned from the [Jekyll tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/).

Until I create some more detailed content here, please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/) or check out [what I'm working on](/what_im_working_on).
