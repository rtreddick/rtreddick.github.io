# About Me
{: .fs-9}

I transform data science research into production Spark applications. My professional interests include ML, streaming, and statistics. Currently, I'm figuring out how to build this website!

Learning is my first passion.

Working as an engineer demands that I develop new skills and gain knowledge every day. It challenges me to apply what I've learned in creative ways to solve difficult problems. I currently work in data engineering - transforming messy data, writing Spark applications, and practicing DevOps. Every day I work to develop my craft as a data and software engineer, and I'm always looking for opportunities to combine those skills with my passion for math and statistics. In brief, I love my work.

Growing up, I had never met someone who wrote code for a living, and I never considered computer programming as a career path. When it came time to choose a college, I enrolled in the architecture program at the University of Cincinnati - a way to combine my interests in math and art. What a long strange (and rewarding) trip it's been since then! I transferred from the architecture program to the School of Planning, where I graduated with a BS in Urban Studies. I worked for a real estate developer focused on urban revitalization, got involved in urban farming, and met my future wife at a meetup hosted by our neighborhood redevelopment foundation! I would spend the following years working in the construction industry. I ran a selective demo crew on a historic rehab, worked as a project coordinator, and eventually found a niche in construction accounting.

After years working as a consultant and accountant for construction companies, I asked myself 'What do I really want to spend my life doing?' Three years later, I graduated with a master's degree in statistics. I fell in love with math again during that time, and I learned a language I had never known in statistics. I also took my first computer science courses during those years, and I've been driven to learn more every day since. Solving complex problems in code is the creative outlet that I never knew I was missing.

My job at 84.51Â° - a retail data science, insights, and media company - has been an incredible professional introduction to engineering and data science. I've had the opportunity to work with huge data sets, collaborate with other engineers, data scientists, and product owners, and to nurture my talent for abstract thinking and problem solving. With our Clickstream team, I prototyped a more performant and maintainable way to process our data - which is now headed to production - using Delta Live Tables on Azure Databricks. As part of our Forecasting Center of Excellence, I'm currently working with data scientists to productionize features that improve forecast performance.
