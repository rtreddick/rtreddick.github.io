# About Me
{: .fs-9}

I transform data science research into production Spark applications. My professional interests include ML, streaming, and statistics. Currently, I'm figuring out how to build this website!

## Learning is my first passion

Working as an engineer demands that I develop new skills and gain knowledge every day. It challenges me to apply what I've learned in creative ways to solve difficult problems. As a data engineer at [84.51°](https://www.8451.com/), I’ve been spending my time transforming messy data, writing Spark applications, and practicing DevOps. With our Clickstream team, I prototyped a more performant and maintainable way to process our data - which is now headed to production - using Delta Live Tables on Azure Databricks. As part of our Forecasting Center of Excellence, I'm currently working with data scientists to productionize features that improve forecast performance. Every day I work to develop my craft, and I'm always looking for opportunities to combine those skills with my passion for math and statistics!

## What a long strange trip it's been

Growing up, I had never met someone who wrote code for a living, and I never considered computer programming as a career path. When it came time to choose a college, I enrolled in the architecture program at the University of Cincinnati - a way to combine my interests in math and art. What a long strange (and rewarding) trip it's been since then! I transferred from the architecture program to the School of Planning, where I graduated with a BS in Urban Studies. I worked for a real estate developer focused on urban revitalization, got involved in urban farming, and met my future wife at a meetup hosted by our neighborhood redevelopment foundation! I would spend the following years working in the construction industry. I ran a selective demo crew on a historic rehab, worked as a project coordinator, and eventually found a niche in construction accounting. I worked for several years as consultant - teaching Quickbooks best practices to contractors, providing job costing and accounting services, and helping with project estimation.

## The creative outlet I never knew I was missing

After several years in construction accounting, I asked myself 'What do I really want to spend my life doing?' In the fall of 2018, I re-enrolled as a student at UC and started taking calculus during my lunch hour. Three years later, I graduated with a master's degree in statistics. I fell in love with math again during that time, and I learned a language I had never known in statistics. I also took my first computer science courses during those years, and I've been driven to learn more every day since. Solving complex problems in code is the creative outlet that I never knew I was missing. Check out [what I'm working on](/what_im_working_on).

## Our little family

My wife and I recently welcomed our first son into the world! Our little family also includes two rescue dogs - Willie and Waylon. We live in downtown Cincinnati where we're just a walk away from amazing restaurants, riverfront parks, and plenty of entertainment - arts, sports, and live music. I've had many hobbies over the years including playing chess, gardening, and practicing yoga. I spend most of my time these days hanging out with my family and learning more about engineering and data science.
