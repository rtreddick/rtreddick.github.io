# What I'm Working On
{: .fs-9}
Here's how I've been spending my time recently. I'm working to grow as a data engineer, learn more about ML, and improve my coding skills.

### Data Engineering with Databricks (Databricks Academy Course)
I recently passed the [Databrick Certified Data Engineering Associate Exam](https://www.databricks.com/learn/certification/data-engineer-associate), which this course prepared me for. The content covered Databricks tools and features, but it also more generally covers data engineering patterns using Spark.

### Optimizing Apache Spark on Databricks (Databricks Instructor-Led Training)
I took this course in February of 2023 with about 15 other coworkers. It covered the five most common performance problems for Spark optimization: skew, spill, shuffles, storage, and serialization. I'm actively looking for opportunities to recognize and fix these problems in my work.

### Social Media API using FastAPI (FreeCodeCamp.org Tutorial)
I created a [website](https://timreddick.me/fcc-fastapi) to highlight some of what I've learned from this course and to practice building a documentation site. This is a pretty comprehensive tutorial that covers setting up a PostgreSQL database, developing the API, and deploying to multiple environments. You can also visit my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rtreddick/fcc-fastapi).

### Machine Learning with Python (MITx Online Graduate Course)
I took this course in the summer of 2022. It began by covering linear classifiers and moved on to regression, neural networks, clustering, and reinforcement learning. I learned a ton and passed the course, but I would do well to revisit the second half in more detail. Here are the links to the [course on edX](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:MITx+6.86x+2T2022/home) and my [repo](https://github.com/rtreddick/6.86x-ml-with-python).

### Machine Learning in Production (Databricks Academy Course)
I just started working on this course, which will prepare me for the [Databricks Certified Machine Learning Associate](https://www.databricks.com/learn/certification/machine-learning-associate) exam. I've got a Master's degree in statistics and have spent some time [studying ML](#machine-learning-with-python-mitx-online-graduate-coruse), but this course will help me be a better practitioner. I'm hope to apply some of what I learn here to my work.

### Advent of Code (Coding Challenge)
2022 was the first year I participated in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about). My coworker started a private leaderboard, which motivated me to get involved! I achieved gold stars through day 18, excluding Days 16 and 17, on which I got silver stars. I'd like to go back and complete the remaining days (although I might need a little help from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) as they get more difficult!) Here's the link to my [repo](https://github.com/rtreddick/advent-of-code).

### Google Foobar (Coding Challenge)
In the summer of 2022, I received an invite to the Google Foobar challenge. I completed 6 challenges over 3 levels, but my time expired as I was working through level 4. It was still a lot of fun, and I'm glad I invested the time. Here's the link to my [repo](https://github.com/rtreddick/google-foobar).

### SnakeSay (Real Python Code Conversation)
I heard this code conversation promoted on the [Real Python Podcast](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/). I learned that pyproject.toml is the current standard for Python packaging config and that pip installing in editable mode is the best way to ensure your relative and absolute imports work correctly while developing your project. These concepts were discussed as we built a simple command line tool that would printed a little snake saying your desired message! Here is the link to my [repo](https://github.com/rtreddick/rp-snakesay).
