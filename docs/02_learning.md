# What I've Learned (So Far)
{: .fs-9}

I've learned about API develompent and much more.

{: .note }
I'll come back and add more to this section at a later date. I'm still working through the back half of the course, but I wanted to share my progress. I'd like to post a few code examples and talk about some of the sticking points I faced when working through this proje. I'm very near the point of deploying the application.

## Why I took this course

I've been interested in learning how to develop API's for a while now, but haven't had a chance to develop one professionally. I have interacted with API's through my work, and doing this tutorial has given me a much greater understanding of what an API really is and how they work. I could imagine this training coming in handy if I ever want to write up an API to serve an ML model. This project will serve as additional documentation of patterns and code that I can use when that time comes. My professional development experience has mostly focused on data engineering tasks such as building Spark applications hosted on Hadoop or Databricks. I see this course as a breadth-of-knowledge opportunity to help me develop more skills as a software engineer and also a change get practice implementing CI/CD patterns.

## Topics already covered

This tutorial has familiarized me with many aspects of web dev, databases, and APIs. Here are just a few of the topics I've studied so far:

- FastAPI path operations, routers, and general API structure
- Pydantic models for schema validation 
- Setting up a PostgreSQL database locally
- Database design, table constraints, and foreign keys
- Authorization using bearer tokens / JWT
- Using SQLAlchemy as an ORM for interacting with a database
- Using a .env file with Pydantic base settings to manage local config
- Useful Postman features such as collections and environment variables
- Solving all of the little issues that arise with Python libraries, package management, venvs, etc. that arise when trying to get something actually running on your machine!

## Next Steps

I'll be working on deploying my API using one or more of the methods taught in the course. I have some experience using **GitHub actions** for build and deployment pipelines, but this will be one more chance to practice those skills and also automate unit and intergration tests. I'll write more once I complete that task!
